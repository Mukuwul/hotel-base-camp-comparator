# SPR26_D2_P03: Hotel Base-Camp Comparator
*AI-Assisted Coding Interview Problem*

---

# Problem Statement

You and your friends are finally taking the city trip that has lived in the group chat for months. Everyone has already agreed on the wishlist: famous landmarks, a museum, a night market, a riverside walk, and several places that serve food the city is known for. Nothing is being removed from that list.

One decision is still causing an argument. A cheap hotel may leave the group crossing the city all day, while the hotel beside the most popular attraction may use too much of the lodging budget. Promotional phrases such as “centrally located” are not helping anyone compare the real trade-off.

Build an interactive **Hotel Base-Camp Comparator** for the group. It should compare complete-stay hotel prices with known round-trip travel times to every wishlist place, recommend the most accessible affordable hotel, and explain the choice clearly enough to settle the discussion.

The tool is a base-camp decision aid, not an itinerary planner. It does not choose places, arrange days, find routes, or estimate admission, meal, or transport costs. The group has set aside one budget for the complete hotel stay, and a place that matters more to them should influence the accessibility result more strongly.

Create the fictional city and all demonstration and test data yourself; no starter asset is supplied. Your main city must contain exactly **10 hotels** and **15 wishlist places**. Include both attractions and signature food stops, give the places memorable names, and position all 25 markers on a schematic map. Independently document the expected totals and rank order for the main scenario. Your application must calculate its decisions from hotel costs, importance values, and travel times—it must not read the documented answers as ranking input.

You are not expected to build a 150-cell data-entry screen. The candidate-created travel matrix may be stored as constants or produced once by a deterministic generator that does not use map geometry or randomness. In either case, materialize and inspect the same stable 10-by-15 matrix on every reset, and verify the expected results through a separate calculation path such as a spreadsheet or explicit test constants. A general city editor and file importer are not required.

Design the main scenario to tell a useful decision story. At its initial budget:

- from `4` through `7` hotels are affordable;
- the hotel with the unique lowest accessibility total is over budget;
- the recommended affordable hotel is not the cheapest affordable hotel; and
- at least one affordable hotel has every round trip at or below `90` minutes, while another affordable hotel has at least one round trip above `90`; and
- raising the budget to the cost of that most accessible hotel makes it the recommendation.

Also choose one place whose importance can be changed within `1–5` so that the recommended affordable hotel changes. This gives the group two meaningful “what if?” moments instead of a table with an obvious winner.

Here is a deliberately tiny illustration of the calculation; it is not large enough to be your main city. Suppose `CLOCK` has importance `3` and `MARKET` has importance `2`. A hotel with round trips of `20` and `40` minutes has a weighted travel total of `(3 × 20) + (2 × 40) = 140` importance-minutes and a weighted average of `140 / 5 = 28.0` minutes. A hotel is considered only when its complete-stay cost is no greater than the current budget.

Create one attractive comparison workspace. It should combine a ranked hotel view with a labelled city map, cost and budget information, and an explanation of the selected hotel's calculation. The map must show all 10 hotels and 15 places, but highlight comparison links only from the hotel currently being inspected so the display stays readable. Let the user load the city in one action, change the budget and place importance, inspect any hotel, and reset the original trip.

A browser application is a natural fit, although another local interactive solution with an equally clear visual map is acceptable. Use familiar technology and keep processing local. Accounts, databases, live maps, geocoding, hotel booking, traffic services, route finding, and external APIs are outside scope.

## Contracts

### City and trip data

- Use one currency consistently. `budget` is the whole-number amount from `0` through `1,000,000` available for the complete hotel stay, not a nightly allowance.
- The calculation engine must support from `2` through `10` hotels and from `3` through `15` wishlist places. The main demonstration must use exactly 10 hotels and 15 places.
- Hotel and place IDs must be unique across the complete scenario and match `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_-]{0,15}`. Display names must be non-empty after surrounding whitespace is removed.
- Each place has a `type` of `attraction` or `food` and a whole-number `importance` from `1` through `5`. The main scenario must include at least three places of each type and use at least three different importance values.
- Each hotel has a `stay_cost`, the quoted whole-number price from `1` through `1,000,000` for the complete stay.
- Each hotel has a `round_trip_minutes` mapping whose keys exactly match all wishlist place IDs. Every value is the complete hotel-to-place-to-hotel time and must be a whole number from `1` through `600`. Missing and unknown place IDs are invalid.
- Marker positions are presentation data. Pixel distance and line length must never be used to calculate travel time, accessibility, or ranking.
- Every wishlist place participates in every baseline comparison. Inspecting a hotel changes only the visible explanation and highlighted links, not the result.

### Accessibility, affordability, and ranking

For each hotel `h` and place `p`, calculate:

```text
contribution(h, p) = importance(p) × round_trip_minutes(h, p)
importance_total = sum of all place importance values
weighted_travel_total(h) = sum of all contribution(h, p) values
weighted_average_minutes(h) = weighted_travel_total(h) / importance_total
remaining_budget(h) = budget - stay_cost(h)
```

- `weighted_travel_total` is an integer measured in importance-minutes. Lower is better. Use this exact total for every comparison.
- Display the weighted average to one decimal place using round-half-up for non-negative values. An integer-only equivalent is `rounded_tenths = floor((20 × weighted_travel_total + importance_total) / (2 × importance_total))`; display `rounded_tenths / 10`. Display rounding must not influence ranking.
- A hotel is affordable exactly when `stay_cost <= budget`; equality is included. Keep an over-budget hotel visible, label it `Over budget by X`, give it no numerical rank, and never recommend it.
- Sort affordable hotels by exact `weighted_travel_total` ascending, then `stay_cost` ascending, then hotel ID in ascending ASCII order. Names, input order, map position, and displayed average do not break ties.
- Assign unique ranks `1, 2, 3, ...` without gaps. Rank 1 is the single `Recommended` hotel.
- If no hotel is affordable, show `NO_AFFORDABLE_HOTEL`, retain each shortfall, and show no recommendation or numerical rank. This is a valid comparison result, not a data-validation error.

### Validation, interaction, and explanation

- Validate the complete scenario before ranking. Reject an invalid count, malformed or duplicate ID, empty name, unsupported place type, out-of-range budget, stay cost, importance, or travel time, and an incomplete or extra hotel-to-place mapping.
- An invalid result must identify the problem and clear stale ranks, recommendation, contributions, and derived map highlights. Do not produce a partial ranking from valid-looking records.
- The visible app must demonstrate invalid handling for an editable budget or importance. Structural errors may be demonstrated through repeatable candidate-authored tests; a general-purpose city-data editor is not required.
- Changing only the budget recalculates affordability, shortfalls, ranks, and recommendation without changing travel contributions. Changing an importance value recalculates every contribution, total, average, rank, and relevant chart or link label.
- **Reset** restores all candidate-created city data, the original budget and importance values, the documented recommendation, and the default inspected hotel.
- Show all 25 labelled markers on a schematic map. When a hotel is inspected, highlight only its 15 hotel-to-place comparison links and expose the supplied round-trip time and weighted contribution for each. These are comparison links, not calculated roads or routes.
- Keep the map synchronized with an accessible hotel-by-place time table or equivalent view, ranked hotel cards or rows, eligibility reasons, and a contribution detail or chart. Use text or symbols as well as colour to identify the recommendation and excluded hotels.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Required:** Create and load in one action a deterministic fictional city with exactly 10 hotels and 15 wishlist places, at least three attractions and three food stops, at least three importance values, and a complete 10-by-15 travel-time mapping. Do not depend on a supplied asset or external service.
- **Required:** Satisfy and document the main-scenario story conditions: 4–7 hotels initially affordable, the unique most accessible hotel over budget, the recommended hotel different from the cheapest affordable hotel, at least one affordable hotel on each side of the `90`-minute longest-trip boundary, and the most accessible hotel becoming recommended exactly at its stay-cost boundary.
- **Required:** Independently record every hotel's expected weighted total, one-decimal average, affordability, shortfall or remaining budget, and initial rank. Reproduce them in the application without using the recorded answers as calculation input.
- **Required:** Show all 25 map markers while highlighting only the inspected hotel's 15 links. Show each link's supplied round-trip time and contribution, the complete-stay price comparison, ranked hotel results, and a clear reason for every unranked hotel.
- **Required:** Raise the budget across the documented hotel-cost boundary and demonstrate the new recommendation. Change the chosen place's importance to the documented value and demonstrate a different affordable recommendation. Reset both changes exactly.
- **Required:** Demonstrate that a hotel exactly on budget is affordable, one currency unit over budget is unranked, an accessibility tie is resolved by stay cost, and a complete tie is resolved by hotel ID. The tie cases may use smaller candidate-authored test scenarios.
- **Required:** Demonstrate `NO_AFFORDABLE_HOTEL` with no stale winner. Visibly reject an invalid budget or importance, and use repeatable test evidence to reject at least one duplicate-ID case and one incomplete or unknown travel-time mapping.
- **Required:** Include focused tests or equivalent repeatable evidence for contribution arithmetic, round-half-up display, exact ranking despite rounded averages, both tie-breaks, budget equality, budget and importance changes, invalid-state clearing, the no-affordable result, hotel inspection, and reset.
- **Optional:** Add a compact budget timeline showing the amounts at which the recommendation changes, while preserving the same affordability and ranking rules.
